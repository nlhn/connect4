      <h3>Connect 4</h3>
      <p>Players take turns placing checkers into the grid until one player has a row of 4 of their checkers in a row. </p>
      <p>The row can be up and down (vertical), across (horizontal), or diagonal. The first player to make a row wins the game.</p>
  
      <p>To move: Place a checker in any column containing fewer than 6 pieces. The checker will fall to the lowest available space in that column.</p>
      <p>To win: Be the first to create a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal contiguous line of four or more pieces.</p>
      
      <h3>Toot and Otto</h3>
      <p>Similar to connect 4, There are two types of pieces in Toot and Otto - the T and the O. Each player can place either T or O on the board.</p>
      <p>To move: On your turn, insert one of your pieces (either T or O) into one of the columns. The piece will fall to the lowest available row in the column. A piece cannot be inserted into a column that is full.</p>
      <p>One player will have the name "TOOT", and the other player will have the name "OTTO".</p>
      <p>To win: The first player to get their name - either "TOOT" or "OTTO", depending on which player they are - spelled on the board horizontally, vertically, or diagonally is the winner.</p>
      <p>it is possible for a player to complete the opponent's name for them, in which case the opponent wins.</p>
      <p>The game is a tie if "TOOT" and "OTTO" are simultaneously completed in a single move or if all pieces have been placed and neither TOOT nor OTTO has been spelled.</p>
